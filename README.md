## Table Tennis Macedonia (ttmk)
### Databases project 2019/20

`Table Tennis Macedonia (ttmk)` is a web app that stores & displays results, statistics, ranking lists for tournaments, matches, players, etc.
for the table tennis community in Macedonia. This project was developed as part of an assignment for the course
'Databases' at FCSE - Skopje (2019/20) which covers topics related to `Relational Databases`, under the mentorship of prof. Vangel Ajanovski ([website](https://ajanovski.info/)).

The project consists of three parts: `database` (PostgreSQL), `RESTfull web service` (Spring) and `web client` (React).
Each part is contained in a separate folder: `database/`, `web/`, `front-end/`, respectively.

Some of the concepts covered in 'Databases' that are expressed in this project:
- Relational database conceptual design (ER modeling)
- Relational database logical design and creation
- SQL queries
- Normalization
